# Why did I choose this project?

I've chosen a project that I think I can carry out eventually. The theme that I`ve chosen really attracts me, so it's going to be easier to work with.
The idea it's to create a web app that allow people to interact with sport clothes. Anyone can upload an item of clothing to sell it, considering that it suitable for the web.


## Project Information


Each item will have the next information:

- Size
- Brand
- Color
- Price
- Discount
- Season


## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript it's one of the most useful programming languages nowadays, so that's why I've chosen it. Moreover, this last summer I've been learning it a bit and I'd like to fully understand it and learn a lot more about it
