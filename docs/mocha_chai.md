# Chai

Chai has three interfaces: should , expect and assert, you can choose which one you want to use.

# Why did I choose Mocha and Chai?

I had no idea about what test framework was the better for the project so I started to look for information about test frameworks, mainly Mocha and Jest.
I saw a couple of tutorials about Mocha and Chai, like this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLTRHc5dk6s&t=739s) and I realised that it was really easy to use.
- Reasons why I am using Mocha and Chai
  - Plenty of documentation on [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) websites
  - Easy to use with npm
  - Easy to create and run tests
  - Chai it's really helpful
  - SupportsTDD and BDD
  - One of the most used and supported frameworks
  - Be able to choose between Chai interfaces.
  
 You have to indicate the test route in package.json and to run it use:
 
 ~~~
 $ npm test
 ~~~
