# Chai 
[Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) is a BDD/TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

# Why did I choose Mocha and Chai?

I had no idea about what test framework was the better for the project so I started to look for information about test frameworks, mainly Mocha and Jest.
I saw a couple of tutorials about Mocha and Chai, like this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLTRHc5dk6s&t=739s) and I realised that it was really easy to use.
So after take a look in Chai and Mocha documentation I decided to use it.

## Installation 

- To use it I have installed it as a dependecy:
~~~
$ npm install --save-dev mocha chai
~~~
