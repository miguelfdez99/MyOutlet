# This are the tools I have chosen for the project:

- Programming language: [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript)

- Environment: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- Database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

- Logs: [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)

- Test: [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)


# Why NPM?

For the moment I have chosen npm,it is the default package manager for Node.js. Npm is installed with Node.js,  so you have to install Node.js in order to install npm. When we install new packages npm install them locally inside the node_modules folder, we can install them globally if needed though. You can specify all the dependencies of the project in the file package.json. So, to install it you just have to run:
~~~
$ npm install
~~~

and all the project's dependencies will be install. You can also specify which version you are going to use.
- Reasons why I've chosen npm 
  - It's really easy and simple to use and manage dependencies. 
  - There are plenty of documentation on the [npm web](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/)
  - npm hosts over tens of thousands packages.
  - npm only need the file package.json to manage dependencies.
  - npm doesn't have I/O bounds like others task managers.

### NPM vs others package managers
Right now, I don't need any further package manager, I just need some utilities for the moment, which npm can carry out perfectly. Maybe in the next weeks I need to use another task manager.
