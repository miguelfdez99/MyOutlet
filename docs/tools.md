# Package manager

For the moment I have chosen npm,it is the default package manager fro Node.js. When we install new packages npm install them locally inside the node_modules folder, we can install them globally if needed though. 

### Why NPM?

Right now, I don't need any further package manager, I just need some utilities for the moment, which npm can carry out perfectly. Maybe in the next weeks I need to use another one, if that's the case, I will use Gulp, because I have read some articles about it and  I think it's going to be more suitable than others.
Also, npm it's easy and simple to use.
